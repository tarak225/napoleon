<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">FDA Specifications for Food Allergen Labeling</a><a class="headerlink" href="#fda-specifications-for-food-allergen-labeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA), food labels are required to state clearly whether the food is or contains any ingredient that is a &#8220;major food allergen.&#8221; The law defines a major food allergen to mean any one of the following eight foods/food groups or an ingredient that contains their proteins:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>milk,</li>
<li>egg,</li>
<li>fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod),</li>
<li>Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp),</li>
<li>tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, or pecans),</li>
<li>peanuts,</li>
<li>wheat, and</li>
<li>soybeans.</li>
</ul>
<p>FALCPA excludes from the definition of a major food allergen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>raw agricultural commodities (e.g., fresh fruits and vegetables),</li>
<li>highly refined oils made from one of the eight foods/food groups defined as a major food allergen,</li>
<li>ingredients made from such oils, and</li>
<li>any ingredient that is exempt under a petition or notification process specified in FALCPA.</li>
</ul>
<p>FALCPA requires that food source names of any major food allergen used to make a food be stated either: (1) within the product&#8217;s ingredient list (e.g. &#8220;Ingredients: ...peanut butter...casein (milk)...wheat flour ...&#8221;) or (2) in a separate &#8220;Contains&#8221; statement (e.g., &#8220;Contains peanuts, milk and wheat&#8221;) immediately following or adjacent to the ingredient list. When multiple ingredients (e.g., casein and whey) contain protein derived from the same major food allergen (e.g., milk), that allergen&#8217;s food source name can be declared just once within the ingredient list in accordance with FALCPA labeling requirements. However, when a FALCPA &#8220;Contains&#8221; statement appears on a food label, it must identify the food source names of all major food allergens contained in the ingredients.</p>
<p>For the purpose of complying with FALCPA labeling requirements, question and answer (Q&amp;A) of FDA&#8217;s guidance document, which is updated periodically to add new questions, explains that the food source name for a species of fish or Crustacean shellfish is its &#8220;market name&#8221; provided in the FDA resource The Seafood List. Q&amp;A provides a table of additional examples of types of tree nuts that are frequently used to make foods. The tree nuts&#8217; common or usual names are their food source names for FALCPA labeling purposes. Q&amp;A also explain that either the plural or singular terms for peanuts, types of tree nuts, and soybeans and that the synonyms soy and soya for soybeans are acceptable for declaring the food source names of the major food allergens on food labels.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Reviews of Food Ingredients and Finished Foods</a><a class="headerlink" href="#reviews-of-food-ingredients-and-finished-foods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This document identifies examples of food ingredients and finished foods that either are or may contain one or more major food allergens. It is not intended to serve as an all-inclusive list. Stated in parentheses after the names of some ingredients/foods are their synonyms and/or a description of what they are or their common uses. Any common synonyms for the terms listed below are also identified using bolded text immediately following those terms in parentheses. Also stated in the parentheses are descriptions of the terms, other related information, and when applicable, reference to the notes section following each allergen subheading.</p>
<p>Some ingredients and finished foods always contain a major food allergen due to their basic nature or when they either have a standard of identity or are otherwise defined or described by Federal law or regulation that confirms the presence of a major food allergen. When ingredients used to make another ingredient or finished food can vary, it may be necessary to review the ingredient specification sheets to determine if the product contains a major food allergen. In other cases, when an ingredient or finished food is derived from the food source of a major food allergen but there is uncertainty about the presence of any protein residue from that allergen, it may be necessary to analyze the food ingredient or the finished food.</p>
